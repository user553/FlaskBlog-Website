Developed a personal blogging website using Python-Flask as backend, Javascript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. The database used is MySQL using sqlalchemy.

The website allows visitors to browse through the posts (articles) I have published, get information about my competences and expertise, leave comments on my posts, and contact me using email and social media.
