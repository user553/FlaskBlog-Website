            Hello! I am a postgraduate student at Cardiff university, School of Computer Science and Informatics. My major is MSc Computing focusing on Datastructures, Algorithms and Data visualisation.

            Now my life isnâ€™t as dramatic as a moviestar. But I can definitely relate my exploration of majors to a similar movie plot. Born in this world as a son of an engineer, I started to play with machines aged 10. My father believed in learning hands on, and taught me a lot of principles by connecting life to the engineering world. For instance, he correlated adding grease at a hinge joint with adding trust in relationships! I have spent a major part of my childhood opening old electronics, trying to understand the motherboard and putting them back together. I liked it a lot, and could imagine nothing else I could be proficient at. Hence, I decided to pursue engineering as my major. I hold a degree in Electrical engineering from SV-NIT, one of Indias most prominent institutions for higher education. During my time at SV-NIT, I have worked on projects ranging from small functional bots to highend solar projects. And this is when my journey with programming began.

            This happened to be the most astounding experience of my life. Once I started to understand the language and program, there was no way I could stop. I wrote codes whenever I had the time. I sometimes had to work my way round to get the code to work, but the win at the end was worth it. I write these blogs to connect to the people who aspire to be a part of the this ongoing revolution called computer science. To provide them with insights in the industry and how it is like to be a freelance web developer.
